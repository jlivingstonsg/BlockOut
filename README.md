# BlockOut for browser in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript 
=======

This is a remake of the 3D Tetris "BlockOut" from 1989. 
I didn't write it, I just made a few modifications. 
The original lives on [Chrome Experiments](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/cubeout/?f=) and was done by [alteredq](https://github.com/alteredq).

My modifications correct the way the pieces rotate. 
Animation can get a little jaggy occasionally, but everything behaves as it should. 
I did not intend to make this perfect but merely playable.

I will try to make it look and work, as the original BlockOut from 1989.
